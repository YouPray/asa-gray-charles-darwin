<p class=TtuloA><a name="_Toc354265676"><span lang=EN-US>Introduction</span></a></p>

<p class=MsoBlockText><span lang=EN-US>I cannot anyhow be contented to view
this wonderful universe, and especially the nature of man, and to conclude that
everything is the result of brute force. I am inclined to look at everything as
resulting from designed laws, with the details, whether good or bad, left to
the working out of what we may call chance. Not that this notion at all
satisfies me. I feel most deeply that the whole subject is too profound for the
human intellect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBlockText><span lang=EN-US>Letter from Charles Darwin to Asa Gray,
May 22, 1860<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><b><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:130%'>[1]</span></b></span></span></a></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The publication of <i>On the Origin of
Species</i> by Charles Darwin in 1859 was one of the greatest milestones in the
history of Biology. This work received a warm welcome on the part of many
scientists but also caused great controversy. The controversy was principally
surrounding its ideas that the living world was governed by chance and material
forces, instead of being guided by a Divine Plan as William Paley did in his
1802 work <i>Natural Theology</i>. The astronomer Sir John Herschel, for
example, referred to Darwin's theory as <i>“the law of higgledy-piggledy”</i>
(the law of disorder), referring to the importance of chance presented therein.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>From that moment on, the philosophy of
nature had to confront new challenges particularly related to the problem of
naturalism and finality. One of the principal questions refers to whether there
was or not a plan guiding evolution: that is to say, if evolution relates to a
blind succession of events, or if it is a process that tends towards certain
ends. The main argument of those who deny the existence of an end in evolution
is the presence of <i>chance</i>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In the introductory passage cited, Darwin
says that he feels inclined to see this wonderful universe as the result of <i>laws</i>
and <i>chance</i>, although he later adds that this notion does not appear to
be completely satisfactory. Throughout this study we will seek to clarify the
causes of Darwin’s “dissatisfaction” with respect to the conception of a <i>nomological</i>
design open to the incidence of accidents</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>During the 150 years that have passed since
the publication of <i>On the Origin</i> there have been made multiple
interpretations related to the role of chance in evolution. More than a few
people have had a vision of evolution as purely random, as if it were a blind
process with neither direction nor finality. Recent scientific research has
shown that there is still much to learn from Nature, and phenomena than
previously were thought to be stochastic are not. Despite this, it is still
common the conception that evolution is a “casual” (random) process whose
results are totally unpredictable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>One example of this are the discussions
about the supposed incompatibility of the theory of evolution with the fact
that living beings, including man, are part of a Divine project. On the one
hand we find those who contend that the random character of the evolutionary
process requires that all of its results are absolutely contingent, so that if,
for example, an asteroid had not struck Earth over 65 million years ago our
species would never have existed. Thus, if we are here it by cheer luck and not
because of Divine design<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><sup><sup><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.5pt;line-height:130%;font-family:"Georgia",serif'>[2]</span></sup></sup></a>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>On the other hand, some people of faith
respond to the “dethronement of man” by taking a hostile attitude towards
science or, at the least, towards Evolutionary Biology. Poorly named
“creationists” promote a literal interpretation of Genesis, while others, such
as proponents of the <i>Intelligent Design</i>, claim to see in what science
has yet to explain the indication of God’s direct intervention, rejecting the
possibility that natural causes for said phenomena can be found in the future.
In such discussions we find a basic problem: considering biological evolution
as a process which, in the absence of direct intervention from God, fails any
kind of finality.</span></p>

<p class=TtuloC><a name="_Toc327974014"><span lang=EN-US>Objectives and content
of this work</span></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The objective of this study is to address
two related questions: (1) the belief that evolution is a process eminently <i>driven
by chance</i>, and (2) that it is <i>lacking in finality</i> and, as such, its
results cannot be part of a Divine project. Considering evolution as such gives
chance a central role in the evolutionary process and leads many to a
reductionist interpretation of the presence of chance in said process.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>We assert that Darwin has had an enormous
influence on this <i>casual</i> vision of evolution, not only for the central
role he gave to chance in his hypothesis, but also for how he understands its
role in the evolutionary process. For this reason, we studied the position that
the English naturalist had, analyzing what <i>causes</i> he believed intervened
in evolution.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In addition to the study of his most
important writings, we pay particular attention to his correspondence. Darwin,
much like other scientists of his time, made extensive use of correspondence to
exchange ideas with colleagues. In these letters we see his most profound
convictions and the dilemmas that do not appear so clearly in his published
works.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Although Darwin failed to develop in a
systematic way the concept of chance and causation in <i>On the Origin of
Species</i>, little by little his treatment of these notions became more
profound thanks to the intense correspondence he held with an eminent Harvard
professor, the botanist Asa Gray. Gray rapidly accepted the theory of evolution
and played a decisive part in its acceptance in the United States, even though
he did not share Darwin’s emphasis on the “causal” character of variations<a
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><sup><sup><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:10.5pt;line-height:130%;font-family:"Georgia",serif'>[3]</span></sup></sup></a>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>One of the central themes in the almost 300
letters exchanged between Darwin and Gray we studied is “design,” which for
them referred to the compatibility between the mechanism proposed by Darwin and
the existence of a Divine plan in evolution. Surrounding this problem, Darwin
and Gray formulated with more precision their vision of chance, the causes of
evolution, contingency and the laws of nature.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>We analyzed what concept Darwin and Gray
had for the causal action on evolution and what role they attributed to chance.
Despite the fact that both were naturalists and not philosophers, the
discussions we will analyze can be sorted into the three branches of
philosophy: the philosophy of nature, the philosophy of science and natural
theology.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Although history occupies an important part
of this work, its focus is not only historical but also metaphysical.
Concretely, we have analyzed these questions in light of classical Aristotelian
philosophy, as this Greek philosopher not only was the first to systematically
study the concepts of chance and causation, but also studied biology closely
from a metaphysical perspective.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>For this reason, in the first chapter we
will carefully study the thinking of Aristotle with regard to the notions most
relevant to our study: causality, chance, nature, the soul and necessity.
Finally, we will see how he integrated all of these concepts in his biological
works, which comprise more than a fourth of his writings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The second chapter will be a study of the
influence Newton and Herschel had on the formation and thinking of Darwin with
respect to the causes, and in concrete the concept of the <i>vera causa</i>
that Herschel made popular in British science in the nineteenth century. We
will also look at the way in which this concept influenced the work of Darwin
and how the Darwinian theory was received by of the scientific community and by
Herschel himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In light of the fact that the discussion
between Darwin and Gray is strongly related to what it is called “the argument
of design,” in the third chapter we will consider the principal currents in
natural theology in England in the nineteenth century, and the development of
the idea of design that Darwin had up until the moment that <i>On the Origin of
Species</i> was published. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In the fourth chapter we will assess the
way Asa Gray helped to foster the positive reception of Darwinism in the United
States. We will also analyze some of the articles he published about Darwin’s
book in 1860 and the beginning of his dialogue with Darwin regarding the
question of design. Thus, we can observe how Gray emphasized the compatibility
between Darwin’s theory and Christianity, while Darwin emphasized the
impossibility to see a Divine project in evolution.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In the fifth chapter we will address how
the debate developed, analyzing two works in which Darwin showed Gray the
existence of “accidents” in evolution, that is to say, variations which
–according to Darwin– could not be part of an “intelligent” plan. We will also
see the way in which Gray changed his position after 1874, as it is reflected
in his essay published in 1876 and two conferences given to theology students
in 1880 at Yale.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In the sixth chapter we will see some
recent interpretations of the role of chance in evolution and reflect on how a
metaphysical understanding of chance and causation in evolution can help to
overcome some of the problems identified.</span></p>

<p class=TtuloC><span lang=EN-US>Sources and translations</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>We used Darwin’s correspondence available
on the <i>Darwin Correspondence Project</i> (http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk) of
Cambridge University, wherein we find the majority of Darwin’s letters
published since 1985<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><sup><sup><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.5pt;line-height:130%;font-family:"Georgia",serif'>[4]</span></sup></sup></a>.
For each letter we indicate a number (<i>entry</i>) that appears in the
Catalogue of correspondence adopted by the <i>Darwin Correspondence Database</i>
(<i>DCD</i>). Darwin’s works were referenced using the versions available on <i>Darwin-Online</i>
(http://darwin-online.org.uk) as it is fundamental in many cases to use the
exact edition related to the issues addressed by Darwin and Gray.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>We refer to the works of Aristotle using a
range of English, Spanish and Italian translations. In cases where there are
different interpretations of the same text, we refer to the original Greek for
the purpose of greater precision. As such it was an arduous task, but well
worth the effort.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>All of the translations are ours and we
intend to be the most faithful possible to the original meaning, placing
precision above elegance. Italics and numbering within citations are also ours
– unless indicated to the contrary.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Finally I would like to thank all of the
people who have made this study possible. In a particular way, I wish to
recognize Professor Rafael A. Martínez for his immense support in these three
years of work. I also appreciate the valuable comments and suggestions of
Professors Phillipe Dalleur and Ruben Pereda.</span></p>
